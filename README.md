## Overview

KineToxin is a Windows-based educational malware research project designed to demonstrate advanced spyware techniques, anti-analysis mechanisms, and evasion strategies. This project serves as a learning resource for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and students studying malware analysis and defense techniques.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **GPS Location Tracking**: Access and monitor device location data
- **Message Interception**: Capture and analyze communications
- **Audio/Video Recording**: Access camera and microphone for surveillance
- **Remote Data Exfiltration**: Separate main functions from calling functions for distributed operations

### Security Evasion
- **Anti-Analysis Mechanisms**: Techniques to prevent reverse engineering
- **Anti-Debugging**: Methods to detect and evade debugging attempts
- **Anti-Virus Evasion**: Strategies to avoid detection by security software
- **LOLBAS Integration**: Leveraging PowerShell and other living-off-the-land binaries

### Target Platform
- **Primary Target**: Windows Operating Systems
- **Architecture**: Modular design for easy development and maintenance
