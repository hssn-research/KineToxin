## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (This Sprint)

### Priority 1: Development Environment Setup
1. **Install Required Software**
   ```bash
   # Will be executed after environment setup
   # Visual Studio 2022 installation
   # Windows SDK configuration
   # Git LFS setup for binary assets
   ```

2. **Create Source Code Structure**
   - Initialize src/ directory with all modules
   - Create CMakeLists.txt for build configuration
   - Set up include/ directory for headers
   - Initialize test/ directory structure

3. **Implement Basic Utilities**
   - Crypto utilities class
   - Logging framework
   - Configuration parser
   - String manipulation utilities

### Priority 2: First Module Implementation
1. **Location Services Module**
   - Start with basic Windows Location API
   - Implement coordinate extraction
   - Add basic encryption for location data
   - Create unit tests for location functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Notes

### Development Environment Requirements
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 Community/Professional
- **Compiler**: MSVC v143 with Windows 11 SDK
- **Build System**: MSBuild + CMake for cross-compilation
- **Version Control**: Git with signed commits
- **Testing**: Google Test framework for C++, MSTest for C#

### Code Quality Standards
- **Documentation**: Doxygen-style comments for all public APIs
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Security**: Static analysis with PVS-Studio or Clang Static Analyzer
- **Performance**: Profile critical paths with Intel VTune or similar

### Security Considerations During Development
- **Code Signing**: Use test certificates during development
- **Encryption Keys**: Generate unique keys per build
- **Obfuscation**: Apply obfuscation to release builds only
- **Logging**: No sensitive data in development logs

## üìù Development Notes

### Research Insights
- Windows Defender has updated detection patterns for traditional injection techniques
- Modern EDR solutions focus on behavioral analysis rather than signature detection
- PowerShell execution policies becoming stricter in enterprise environments
- TPM and Secure Boot creating additional challenges for persistence

### Lessons Learned
- Modular architecture significantly improves development speed
- Early testing prevents major integration issues
- Documentation quality directly impacts code maintainability
- Security testing must be continuous, not end-of-cycle

### Future Enhancements
- **Linux/macOS Support**: Cross-platform compatibility
- **Mobile Targets**: Android/iOS research extensions
- **IoT Integration**: Smart device interaction capabilities
- **AI/ML Integration**: Behavioral pattern learning
